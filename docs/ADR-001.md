ADR-001: Language Selection for Compiler Implementation
Status: Accepted

Date: 2025-06-21

Context
The project is to build a modern BCPL compiler and runtime system. The design specifications impose several critical technical requirements on the implementation language. The chosen language must be capable of:

Performing low-level memory management, including allocating executable memory pages with mmap and changing their permissions with mprotect to support a Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation model.
Generating native AArch64 machine code directly into memory.
Interfacing seamlessly with the C standard library (malloc, fopen, exit, etc.) to adhere to a thin runtime philosophy that leverages the host OS.
Strictly conforming to the AArch64 C ABI for function calls, stack management, and argument passing.
Fulfilling the primary goals of creating a runtime that is safe, stable, and portable.
The decision requires selecting a language that provides the necessary low-level power for systems programming while also supporting the development of a robust, secure, and maintainable application.

Decision
We will use the Rust programming language, along with its standard toolchain (Cargo and crates.io), to implement the BCPL JIT compiler and its runtime environment.

Consequences
Positive

Enhanced Safety and Security: Rust's ownership model and borrow checker will prevent entire classes of memory-related bugs (e.g., use-after-free, buffer overflows, data races) at compile time. This directly supports the stated goal of providing a "more stable and secure environment" than traditional runtimes.
High Performance: Rust offers performance comparable to C, with no garbage collector or virtual machine overhead. This ensures that both the JIT compiler itself and the code it generates will be highly efficient.
Excellent C Interoperability: Rust's Foreign Function Interface (FFI) is mature and efficient, making it straightforward to call the required C library functions (malloc, fopen, etc.) with minimal overhead, as specified in the runtime design.
Productive Tooling: The Cargo build system and package manager will simplify dependency management, testing, and project builds, increasing developer productivity.
Expressive for Compiler Development: Rust's powerful type system, including enums and pattern matching, is exceptionally well-suited for implementing the components of a compiler, such as parsing the BCPL syntax and managing Abstract Syntax Trees.
Negative

Learning Curve: Developers unfamiliar with Rust may require an initial period of adjustment to become proficient with its unique ownership and borrowing concepts.
Compilation Time: Rust's compile-time checks, while beneficial for safety, can lead to longer compilation times compared to C.
Considered Options
1. C

Pros: C provides direct, unparalleled access to low-level memory operations and system calls required by the runtime. Its C ABI interoperability is native.
Cons: C lacks memory safety. The burden of manual memory management makes it difficult to fulfill the core project goal of safety and stability. The risk of introducing security vulnerabilities is significantly higher.
2. Java

Pros: Excellent tooling and a strong type system. Automatic garbage collection simplifies application-level memory management.
Cons: The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is an abstraction layer that makes it fundamentally unsuitable for this project. It cannot directly generate native machine code into a memory buffer or perform the low-level mmap/mprotect operations required by the JIT design. This approach would violate the "thin and understandable" runtime philosophy.
3. Rust (Chosen)

Pros: Rust provides the low-level control and performance of C while guaranteeing memory safety at compile time. It uniquely satisfies the project's dual requirements of power and safety, making it the best fit for all documented specifications.
