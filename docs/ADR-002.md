ADR-002: Overall Design and Organization
Status: Accepted

Date: 2025-06-21

Context
The development of a Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler is an inherently complex undertaking. The process involves several distinct, sequential stages: lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, and execution within a managed runtime. As per the project specifications, our compiler must handle a non-trivial language syntax [cite: BCPL syntax.md], manage a runtime environment with specific memory and I/O requirements [cite: BCPL Runtime.md], and generate native machine code against a precise ABI [cite: ABI.md].

Given this complexity, there is a significant risk that an unstructured or monolithic project organization could lead to tightly coupled components. This would make the codebase difficult to understand, test, debug, and maintain, jeopardizing the project's success. A clear, deliberate architectural decision is required to enforce a clean separation of concerns from the outset.

Decision
We will adopt a modular architecture for the Rust project, organized around the logical stages of the compilation pipeline. The core compiler logic will be encapsulated within a single library crate, which will be consumed by a thin binary executable (main.rs).

The library will be structured into distinct, private modules, each with a single, well-defined responsibility:

runtime.rs: Manages the execution environment. This includes allocating executable memory (mmap/mprotect), maintaining the symbol table for JIT-linking, and providing an interface to the C library functions required by the compiled code.

lexer.rs: The lexical analyzer. It is responsible for converting the raw BCPL source string into a linear sequence of tokens.

parser.rs: The parser. It consumes the token stream from the lexer and produces an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), which is a hierarchical, structured representation of the source program.

codegen/ (Parent Module): Contains all logic related to transforming the AST into executable AArch64 machine code. It will be composed of sub-modules:

aarch64.rs: The primary code generator. Traverses the AST and emits machine code instructions.

regalloc.rs: Manages the allocation and lifecycle of both general-purpose and floating-point CPU registers during code generation.

instruction.rs: Provides helper functions and data structures for encoding AArch64 instructions.

This structure creates a clear data flow pipeline:
String -> Vec<Token> -> AST -> Machine Code

Consequences
Positive

High Maintainability: By isolating responsibilities, changes to one component (e.g., optimizing the register allocator) will have a minimal and well-defined impact on other components.

Enhanced Testability: Each module can be unit-tested independently. For example, the parser can be validated by providing it with a known sequence of tokens and asserting that the output AST is correct, without needing a functional code generator or runtime.

Clear Separation of Concerns: The structure directly enforces a separation between the "front end" (lexing and parsing), the "back end" (code generation), and the "runtime," which is a classic and proven compiler design pattern.

Improved Readability: A developer can navigate directly to the relevant part of the codebase based on the task at hand, significantly reducing cognitive overhead.

Enables Future Extension: Adding new features (e.g., an optimization pass on the AST) can be accomplished by adding a new module into the pipeline with a clearly defined place and purpose.

Negative

Initial Setup Overhead: There is a minor initial cost in defining the public APIs and data structures that are passed between modules (e.g., the Token and AST enums).

Potential for Premature Abstraction: The interfaces between modules must be designed carefully to avoid being either too restrictive or too generic.

Considered Options
1. Monolithic Structure

Description: Placing all logic for the lexer, parser, and code generator into a single lib.rs file or a few very large modules.

Reason for Rejection: This approach was rejected as it would directly lead to the "spaghetti code" problem we aim to avoid. It creates high coupling, makes unit testing nearly impossible, and obfuscates the logical flow of the compiler. It fails to manage the project's inherent complexity.

2. One Crate per Component

Description: Structuring each major component (lexer, parser, etc.) as a completely separate library crate within a single Cargo workspace.

Reason for Rejection: While this provides the ultimate level of separation, it was deemed overly complex for the scope of this project. It introduces significant overhead in managing dependencies and versions between local crates. The chosen approach of a single library with private modules provides sufficient logical separation without the administrative burden of a multi-crate workspace.
