# BCPLRevival

## BCPL revival - exploring BCPL

I like Scheme, and Forth, so naturally I like BCPL.

BCPL is of important cultural and historical significance.

And is actively maintained as well.

Martin Richards, the creator of BCPL, maintains an actively developed version that is platform-independent.

It would be nice if there was a BCPL compiler that directly generated modern efficient X86_64 and ARM64 code
so we could all enjoy it.

Sadly our current LLM systems are not capable of writing a lexer, parser, AST, and code generator for
BCPL, or at least I am not capable of getting them to do that.

Would be a pretty good challenge dont you think, OpenAI, Google ?

Right now I think, they can not take a spec, and apply the knowledge they actually have from all the literature on compiler development to write a compiler for BCPL.

So much for being able to code.

At one point I explained that if the LLM was a co-worker, this would be the point I poured a cup of water on their head.

LLMS can not code, and it is important to remember this, when considering if we need to train new programmers or not.
